One of them decided to make a potion that turns everyone who drinks it into ducks. 
After they made it, they gave it to their chemistry teacher and told her to drink it. 
She hesitantly drank the potion and a quack was heard.All the students cheered, they did it. 
But now they had to give out the potion to others. So they put it in the coffee maker. 
And that's how all of the school staff turned into ducks. The students decided to lock the ducks inside the school, because that's how they all felt there. 
Locked and hopeless. But of course they aren't that cruel to not leave an exit, so they set up a bunch of riddles and traps that lead to it.
And now the teachers need to find their way out or find the antidote. 
Can they do it?
